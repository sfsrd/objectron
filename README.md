# objectron
This repo contains a solution for using tflite models (shoes, mags, camera, chair) for 3D detection, trained with Objectron dataset.
These models output 18 numbers - 9 dots, with I draw with OpenCV methods.
tf_test.py - run model with 1 image.
webcam.py - run model with webcam.
record.py - record & save output video.

So, it can be 3D-mag-detector.
Or 3D-тапочкодетектор.

It's funny. Try it. Enjoy it.
